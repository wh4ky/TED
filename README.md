## About

TermEngine (TE for short) is an engine which allows you to display and maybe make games in the terminal with [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) and [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). TE can be used to make games or simple utilities.

## Soon™

- Processes, process managers and a central process manager.
- GameObjects (objects that contain all data needed for displaying, moving, ect.)
- 2D rendering with OpenCL.

## Somewhere in a galaxy far, far away

- 3D rendering with OpenCL.
- POSIX compatibility.

## Aim Of The Game

I want TE to work flawlessly with Unix systems' TTY. By wanting this, I cannot use OpenGL, Vulcan, Metal, Direct3D, or any other graphics API; I've truly set myself up for failure.
